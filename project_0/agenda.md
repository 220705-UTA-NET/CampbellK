**Solo Presentation: July 20th**

Create a helper directory / namespace to put all methods that do not neatly
fit elsewhere
    -- menu command
    -- createWebServer


Better seperate logic for a cleaner code base
    - Remove any extraneous code from routes
    - some routeMethods have a bit too much logic within them
    - Move port & startWebServer to a different file?
        ---- doesn't make sense in UserInput ----


Unit testing for api endpoints


Server still hits issues @ around 4th call

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Add endpoints for categories?
