**Solo Presentation: July 20th**


On startup in tracking, query db to update totalExpense
    Will need to run dbConn (don't need the http request,
    just call the function)


Further refactoring all files
    - Clear warnings
    - Any condensing I can do?
    - Work on access modifiers; what can I make private/protected?
    - add using to reader.Read() and/or command
    - Use ternary for quick if/else (if any still exist)
