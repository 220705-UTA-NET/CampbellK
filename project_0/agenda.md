Solo Presentation: July 20th
    
    1. Ask user for what command they want to give in a seperate class: 

        - Edit does not work:
            * Not printing all expenses (probably just need to wrinteline)
            * even when given an id, nothing seems to happen

    

    2. After the first or second command, system crashes

    
    3. Handle warnings 
        - Make grabbing of environmental variables its own method within Main
        and error handle with try/catch

    
    5. Remove either the WriteLine or return in the API methods

    Further functionality:
    1. Set a savings goal; send email if go above it

    2. Current monthly expenditure & how much we have left to spend

    3. Categories

    4. Simple auth (fail to login, shut down), transactions only with given name;

    5. Add unit testing for endpoints

    6. For each request, save the information to a txt file or something?
    - Is console really the best way?
    - Perhaps create some sort of identifier to make it easier to read
