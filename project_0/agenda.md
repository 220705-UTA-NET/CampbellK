Solo Presentation: July 20th


    Rename ApiMethods subclasses to be more verbose
        - should include expense somewhere in the name
        - users should be changed to budgetGoal
    

    create subfolders for api, db

    Refactor:
        Should be able to cut down on some code, especially re-instantiation
        of classes (like Tracking in UserInput)


    Make displayed tables (expense detail, etc) more visible by wrapping them
    in ascii table

    
    Server still hits issues @ around 4th call
