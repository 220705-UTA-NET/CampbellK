Solo Presentation: July 20th

    1. Set a savings goal; send email if go above it

        b. Create endpoint to see savings goal
            - Current issue: returns 0 (even though it is not 0)
            - getordinal is what returns 0

        c. Send email when user nears budget limit
            -- Will need to check after each new expense is added




        
    2. Rename ApiMethods subclasses to be more verbose
        - should include expense somewhere in the name
        - users should be changed to budgetGoal
