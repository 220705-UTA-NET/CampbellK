Solo Presentation: July 20th

    When inputting a new expense or updating budget, update value in
    Tracking.cs (currentBudget & currentExpenseTotal) and in JSON
        When value is updated, it will need to overwrite budget.json

    




    Rename ApiMethods subclasses to be more verbose
        - should include expense somewhere in the name
        - users should be changed to budgetGoal
    

    create subfolders for api, db


    Make displayed tables (expense detail, etc) more visible by wrapping them
    in ascii table
