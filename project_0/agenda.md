**Solo Presentation: July 20th**


Unit testing for api endpoints
    - make all routes return a notification of success string
        -- The DB should return a message itself, rather than me making one

        - execute-non-query for insert/update/delete (returns int of number of
        rows effected)


Clear out old data and enter new data for presentation


Further refactoring
