**Solo Presentation: July 20th**


Rename Test content according to standards
    - Comment out the delete tests


On startup in tracking, query db to update totalExpense
    Will need to run dbConn (don't need the http request,
    just call the function)


Further refactoring all files
    - Clear warnings
    - Any condensing I can do?
    - Work on access modifiers; what can I make private/protected?
    - add using to reader.Read() and/or command
    - Use ternary for quick if/else (if any still exist)
