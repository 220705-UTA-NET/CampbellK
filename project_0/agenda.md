**Solo Presentation: July 20th**


Unit testing for api endpoints
    - make all routes return a notification of success string
        -- The DB should return a message itself, rather than me making one

    Will need to be able to create all of the class objects within test
        - create a parent class


Clear out old data and enter new data for presentation


Further refactoring


0 - exit program doesn't entirely exit
