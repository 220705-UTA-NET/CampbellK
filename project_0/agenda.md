Solo Presentation: July 20th
    
    1. Ask user for what command they want to give in a seperate class: 
        - test new expense. IT WORKS!!
    

    2. After the first or second command, system crashes

    
    3. Handle warnings 
        - Make grabbing of environmental variables its own method within Main
        and error handle with try/catch

    4. For each request, save the information to a txt file or something?
        - Is console really the best way?
        - Perhaps create some sort of identifier to make it easier to read
