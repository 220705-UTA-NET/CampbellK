Solo Presentation: July 20th
    
    1. Ask user for what command they want to give in a seperate class: 
        - Does not work; once server starts it is entirely blocking
            ** is there a way to open a new thread?
                - Perhaps open the server on a new thread

    
    2. Handle warnings 
        - Make grabbing of environmental variables its own method within Main
        and error handle with try/catch

    3. For each request, save the information to a txt file or something?
        - Is console really the best way?
        - Perhaps create some sort of identifier to make it easier to read
