**Solo Presentation: July 20th**


For Post & Put routes, move the body parser out into a seperate function that
accepts the httprequest and returns the parsed expense



Further refactoring all files
    - Clear warnings
    - Any condensing I can do?
    - Work on access modifiers; what can I make private/protected?
    - add using to reader.Read() and/or command
    - Use ternary for quick if/else (if any still exist)
