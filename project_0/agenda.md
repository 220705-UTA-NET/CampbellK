Solo Presentation: July 20th
    
    2. Test all endpoints
        - 1, 2, 3 all work
        - 4 works, but crashes after words
            "Changing the URL is not supported because Addresses IsReadOnly."
        - 5 works, but crashes after words
            "Changing the URL is not supported because Addresses IsReadOnly."


        - 6 Should work, but haven't tested it yet
    
    3. Handle warnings 
        - Make grabbing of environmental variables its own method within Main
        and error handle with try/catch

    
    5. Remove either the WriteLine or return in the API methods


    6. Clean up console logs


    7. Throw exceptions in catch() blocks


    8. Clean-up; write more comments @ top of file to better instruct where
    things are coming from

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further functionality:
    1. Set a savings goal; send email if go above it

    2. Current monthly expenditure & how much we have left to spend

    3. Categories

    4. Simple auth (fail to login, shut down), transactions only with given name;

    5. Add unit testing for endpoints

    6. For each request, save the information to a txt file or something?
    - Is console really the best way?
    - Perhaps create some sort of identifier to make it easier to read
