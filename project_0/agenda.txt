Create simple budget CRUD app API that interfaces with CLI
Take inputs from users for various things via Console.ReadLine();
    
    1. Set up webserver, establish routes

    2. Set up endpoints to read, create, edit, delete entries
        a. Ask user for what command they want to give
            - Give a set of possible commands; automatically convert all responses to lower
            - if a typo or unavailable option, rerun Console.ReadLine();
            - if null, give another response and rerun Console.ReadLine();

    3. Further functionality:
        - Current monthly expenditure & how much we have left to spend
        - Categories
