Solo Presentation: July 20th

Create simple budget CRUD app API that interfaces with CLI
Take inputs from users for various things via Console.ReadLine();

Seperate out dbConnection & API endpoints into their own directories
    
    1. The db connection does appear to be opening, but nothing appears to be able to occur afterwards

    2. Set up endpoints to read, create, edit, delete entries
        a. Ask user for what command they want to give
            - Give a set of possible commands; automatically convert all responses to lower
            - if a typo or unavailable option, rerun Console.ReadLine();
            - if null, give another response and rerun Console.ReadLine();

    3. Further functionality:
        - Current monthly expenditure & how much we have left to spend
        - Categories
