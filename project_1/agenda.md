# Project 1 August 2nd (Tuesday)


Instead of messing with time, focus on user ease:


4. Add review mode where you get definition and have to type the word


5. Create a SIMPLE web scrapper that can auto-generated example sentences
both during autoFill & on-command from create menu once you get to example


6. Publish API so that I do not need to run the API myself
    -- Heroku, netlify?
